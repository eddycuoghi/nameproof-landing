  <h1>Can Two Companies Have the Same Name? (2026 Guide for Founders)</h1>
  <div class="article-meta">February 28, 2026 · 8 min read · By NameProof</div>

  <p>Can two companies legally use the same name? It depends on trademark law, industry and geography — and getting this wrong can force a costly rebrand.</p>

  <p>The short answer is: sometimes yes, often no, and the difference can cost you everything you've built.</p>

  <p>This is one of the most common questions founders ask before registering — and one of the most misunderstood. The answer depends on trademark law, jurisdiction, industry category, and whether anyone has bothered to enforce their rights yet.</p>

  <p>If you want to validate your brand name before finding out the hard way, a professional <a href="https://nameproof.io" style="color:#111;font-weight:600;">brand validation report</a> checks trademark conflicts alongside domains, pronunciation, and social handles — delivered within 24 hours for €19.</p>

  <div class="callout">
    <p>💡 A company registration (LLC, Ltd, GmbH) and a trademark are two completely different things. Registering your company name does not protect it. This distinction is where most founders get into trouble.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Business Name Registration vs. Trademark: The Critical Difference</h2>

  <p>When you register a company — an LLC in the US, a Ltd in the UK, an SRL in Italy — you're registering a legal entity with a government agency. This gives you the right to operate as that business name in that jurisdiction.</p>

  <p>What it does not give you: exclusive rights to use that name commercially. Two companies can legally be registered with identical or similar names in different states or countries. The registration office rarely checks for conflicts outside its own database.</p>

  <p>A trademark, on the other hand, gives you exclusive rights to use a name (or logo) in connection with specific goods and services in a specific territory. Trademark law is what actually protects your brand.</p>

  <p>The practical consequence: you can register your company today, operate for two years, and then receive a cease-and-desist letter from a company that trademarked the same name in your industry — even if they registered it after you started operating.</p>

  <h2>When Two Companies Can Have the Same Name</h2>

  <h3>Different industries</h3>
  <p>Trademark protection is category-specific. "Delta" is used by an airline, a faucet manufacturer, and a dental equipment company — because they operate in different trademark classes and don't create consumer confusion. If your brand name is identical to an existing one but in a completely different industry, you may be legally clear.</p>

  <h3>Different geographic markets</h3>
  <p>A company called "Vexar" operating only in Brazil and a company called "Vexar" operating only in Germany may coexist — depending on whether either has filed for international trademark protection. As you scale globally, geographic boundaries become less reliable.</p>

  <h3>Different trademark classes</h3>
  <p>The USPTO, EUIPO, and WIPO organize trademarks into 45 classes (the Nice Classification). A name trademarked in Class 9 (software) doesn't automatically block the same name in Class 25 (clothing). However, well-known brands can claim protection across classes — which is why you can't register "Apple" for almost anything.</p>

  <h2>When Two Companies Cannot Have the Same Name</h2>

  <h3>Same industry, same territory</h3>
  <p>This is the most dangerous scenario. If a company has trademarked your name in your industry and your geographic market, you're at risk — regardless of when you registered your LLC or started using the name.</p>

  <h3>"Confusingly similar" names</h3>
  <p>Trademark law doesn't require identical names. The legal standard is "likelihood of confusion" — whether an average consumer could confuse the two brands. This means a company called "Velorix" could face a challenge from a registered "Velocrix" in the same industry, even with different spelling.</p>

  <p>Factors that determine likelihood of confusion include: similarity of the names (visual, phonetic, conceptual), similarity of the goods or services, the sophistication of the typical buyer, and whether the marks appear in the same sales channels.</p>

  <h3>Famous marks</h3>
  <p>Certain brands — Apple, Nike, Amazon, Google — are considered "famous marks" and receive broader protection across all categories. You cannot trademark "Amazone" for a startup selling software tools, even if Amazon doesn't operate in that exact category.</p>

  <div class="warning">
    <p><strong>Common mistake:</strong> Founders assume that if they can register the LLC name, they're safe. They're not. Company registration and trademark protection are separate systems that don't communicate with each other.</p>
  </div>

  <h2>Real Scenarios: What Happens in Practice</h2>

  <div class="scenario">
    <h3>Scenario 1: Same name, completely different industry</h3>
    <p>You launch a SaaS tool for architects called "Lumino." An existing company called "Lumino" sells artisan candles. Different trademark classes (Class 42 vs Class 4), different customers, different channels.</p>
    <div class="verdict safe">✓ Likely safe — but verify the trademark registration scope before assuming.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="scenario">
    <h3>Scenario 2: Similar name, same industry</h3>
    <p>You launch a project management SaaS called "Taskvex." A company registered "Taskflex" in Class 42 (software) three years ago and has active users.</p>
    <div class="verdict risky">⚠ Risky — a trademark attorney would flag this as a potential likelihood of confusion. Proceed with caution.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="scenario">
    <h3>Scenario 3: Identical name, same industry, different country</h3>
    <p>You're launching in Europe. The identical name is trademarked in the US only, with no EU or WIPO filing. The US company has no European operations.</p>
    <div class="verdict risky">⚠ Currently manageable — but if the US company files internationally or enters your market, you face a conflict. Higher risk as you scale.</div>
  </div>

  <div class="scenario">
    <h3>Scenario 4: Identical name, same industry, same territory</h3>
    <p>You register your company name in Delaware. The exact same name is trademarked in Class 42 by an active US SaaS company.</p>
    <div class="verdict danger">✗ High risk — you're likely infringing an existing trademark. This can result in a cease-and-desist, forced rebranding, and legal costs.</div>
  </div>

  <h2>US vs. EU: Key Differences Founders Should Know</h2>

  <h3>United States (USPTO)</h3>
  <p>The US operates on a "first to use" principle — meaning trademark rights can be established through actual commercial use, even without formal registration. This means an unregistered competitor who used the name before you could have enforceable rights against you. Registration strengthens protection but isn't always required to have rights.</p>

  <h3>European Union (EUIPO)</h3>
  <p>The EU operates primarily on a "first to file" system. Registration is more critical for establishing priority. An EU trademark covers all 27 member states with a single filing — which makes EUIPO filings both powerful and worth monitoring if you're operating in Europe.</p>

  <h3>International (WIPO / Madrid System)</h3>
  <p>The Madrid System allows a single international trademark application to cover multiple countries. A company that has filed a WIPO mark may have protection in dozens of countries simultaneously — even if they have no active presence there yet.</p>

  </div>

  <h2>What To Do Before You Register</h2>

  <p>Before committing to a company name, run three checks in parallel. First, search the trademark databases directly: USPTO.gov for the US, EUIPO.europa.eu for Europe, and WIPO.int for international filings. Search your exact name and phonetically similar variants in your business category.</p>

  <p>Second, Google the name extensively. Search for it in quotes, search it with your industry terms, and look for any active businesses using it — even without a formal trademark. Prior commercial use can create rights in some jurisdictions.</p>

  <p>Third, check domain and social availability. A name that's unavailable everywhere online often signals an active brand — even if they haven't filed a trademark yet.</p>

  <p>If the name clears all three checks, consult a trademark attorney before making significant brand investments. A preliminary screening tells you whether it's worth proceeding. An attorney tells you whether it's safe to build on.</p>

  <h2>The Bottom Line</h2>

  <p>Two companies can have the same name — but whether it's legally safe depends on trademark law, not company registration. The same name in the same industry in the same territory is a direct conflict. Similar names in adjacent categories require careful evaluation. Different industries or geographies may coexist, but carry risk as both companies grow.</p>

  <p>The founders who get this wrong don't lose because they were careless. They lose because they assumed company registration meant brand protection. It doesn't.</p>

  <p>Validate before you build. Check before you register. And if you find a conflict early — it costs hours to fix, not years.</p>
